# YOLOX-main
Using Yolox (an anchor-free version of YOLO) for In-vehicle driver behavior detection (Avoid dangerous driving) to detect and classify 
of 12 different driving postures on the dataset collected by the company. And in order to adapt to the car's microcon-trollerUnit, I have 
lightened the network model and maintained good accuracy and speed. (Official model of Pretrained mAP is 37.4 and I get 43.2)
